# Live-Chat (FullStack)
[Live-Chat](https://fullstack-chat.herokuapp.com/) is a chat which lets you communicate with other users using a Nickname by sending general or direct messages. The messages are stored and retrieved from MongoDB (mLab), the server is built with Express and Node.js. The styling was done with Semantic-UI.
